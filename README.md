Official repository of the Programming and Architecture of Computing Systems
course of the MS in Robotics, Graphics, and Computer Vision

## Code snippets from Class

The directory `code_examples` contains many of the small C++ programs and
fragments from the slides.

To compile them, you can use `cmake`. For example:

```bash
cd code_examples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ # generate the Makefile with cmake
make # compile the examples
ls # list the examples
```
